# Why I Don’t Provide a SaaS, online Website Version. 
This project provides a downloadable install file for PDF merging because:

Do not upload important PDFs to the web
If your files are confidential, they should never need to leave your device just to be merged.


## Your files stay on YOUR computer
There is zero upload to any server. Merging happens completely offline.

## Do not upload important PDFs to the web
Many PDF files contain:
* Private personal data
* Financial records
* Contracts
* IDs, certificates, legal documents

Once uploaded online—even to “temporary merge sites”—you lose control over:
* Who stores the file
* How long it's retained
* Whether it's logged, cached, or analyzed
* Whether it's leaked, sold, or breached

✔ This tool avoids that entirely.

### Reliable without internet

Local software ensures:
* No cloud dependency
* No data tracking
* No stored copies
* No security risk from server breaches
* No internet required

Unlike SaaS platforms, this tool works:
* Offline
* During internet outages
* Without login accounts
* Without subscription fees
* Without API limits
